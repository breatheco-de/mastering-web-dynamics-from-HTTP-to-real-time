# Mastering Web Dynamics: From HTTP to Real-Time

This course follows the complete journey of the HTTP protocol, from the first DNS query to real-time updates with WebSockets. Designed to help beginners understand step by step how websites work.

1. [**Resolving DNS:**](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/mastering-web-dynamics-from-HTTP-to-real-time/blob/main/lessons/resolving-dns.md) Find the server's IP address by translating a domain name like “www.example.com” into a numerical IP address like “192.0.2.1”.

2. [**Server Routing:**](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/mastering-web-dynamics-from-HTTP-to-real-time/blob/main/lessons/server-routing.md) Direct the client's request to the correct server and specific path by interpreting the URL, like delivering an order to the right section of a store.

3. [**Preparing the Response and Replying to the Client:**](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/mastering-web-dynamics-from-HTTP-to-real-time/blob/main/lessons/response-to-the-client.md) Process the request on the server (such as fetching data or rendering HTML) and respond to the client with codes, headers, and appropriate content.

4. [**Parsing the HTML:**](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/mastering-web-dynamics-from-HTTP-to-real-time/blob/main/lessons/parsing-the-html.md) The browser processes the received HTML and builds the DOM as if reading a recipe to plan how the page will look.

5. [**Prioritizing Resource Requests:**](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/mastering-web-dynamics-from-HTTP-to-real-time/blob/main/lessons/prioritizing-resource-requests.md) Load CSS, JavaScript, images, and other resources based on their importance. Learn how the browser decides what to display first.

6. [**Optimizing Page Load:**](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/mastering-web-dynamics-from-HTTP-to-real-time/blob/main/lessons/optimizing-page-loading.md) Explore how the browser uses caching and other strategies to speed up loading and how this impacts development and testing.

7. [**Dynamic Updates with JavaScript:**](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/mastering-web-dynamics-from-HTTP-to-real-time/blob/main/lessons/dynamic-updates-with-javascript.md) Use JavaScript to make new HTTP requests to APIs without reloading the page. Ideal for displaying new data smoothly.

8. [**Debugging API Requests:**]((https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/mastering-web-dynamics-from-HTTP-to-real-time/blob/main/lessons/debugging-api-requests.md)) Learn to inspect and troubleshoot HTTP requests from the browser, understanding the most common methods and formats in RESTful APIs.

9. [**Real-Time Updates with WebSockets:**]((https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/mastering-web-dynamics-from-HTTP-to-real-time/blob/main/lessons/real-time-updates-with-websockets.md)) Establish a continuous connection with the server to receive instant data, such as in live chats or notifications.
